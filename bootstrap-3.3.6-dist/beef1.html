            <p>We have a love-hate relationship with it. We crave its flavor yet are told to keep our intake to a
minimum. This dichotomy was illustrated in a Beef Checkoff-funded study conducted on behalf
of the Cattlemen’s Beef Board by the University of Nebraska. The study revealed that over
70% of consumers visually preferred low marbled steaks. However, high marbled steaks were
rated more juicy, flavorful and acceptable by a taste panel than low marbled ones.
Clearly the flavor and juiciness fat imparts is one of the major reasons why we enjoy – and
crave – beef. There are three types of fat in meat:
1. Subcutaneous or external fat that covers the outside of a carcass
2. Seam or intermuscular fat that runs between muscles
3. Marbling or intramuscular fat that is found within muscles
Marbling, or the visible flecks of fat within muscles, is directly related to the palatability or
flavor and juiciness of cooked beef. There are ten degrees of marbling USDA graders use for
evaluation, from Very Abundant to Practically Devoid.
Marbling affects flavor in two ways:
1. Fatty acids (the building blocks of fat) experience chemical changes during cooking and
produce potent flavor compounds.
2. Fat acts as a storehouse for aromatic compounds that are released during cooking. Many
beef flavor components are found in these aromatic co>We have a love-hate relationship with it. We crave its flavor yet are told to keep our intake to a
