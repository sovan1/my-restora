            <p>Sushi takes sorta like what you would expect. Its like a more glutonoius (chewy) rice wrapped with fresh ingredients (varies). You can barely taste the seaweed paper wrap. That part basically is just used to hold the entire sushi together. 

RAW FISH: Raw fish can be too dramatic or gross for beginners but you will get used to it. In my opinion it doesn't taste bad at all. Sashimi (plain raw fish) is okay IF you don't eat too much of it. 

SUSHI TYPE: There aren't many 'spicy' types of sushi out there. They have a mild (light) spicy taste. These are the typical types: Spicy Tuna Roll, Spicy Salmon, Spicy Crispy Salmon, and Firehouse Roll. 

SAUCES: Typically sushi is dipped with soya sauce. However, it tastes great by itself too! Don't force yourself to use it if you don't like it. Oh, and don't dunk it in just dip it in. Since you like spicy foods, add and mix wasabi to the soya sauce. Wasabi is that green mushy paste. Just add enough to your liking. Ginger is also optional.
