            <p>Just. Put. It. In. Your. Mouth. and try it.



I could tell you it sort of taste like turkey but a little less bland, but I'm going to take a wild guess and assume you haven't tasted turkey either.  If you've never had meat in your mouth, I don't know how to describe it to you.  Chicken tastes unlike any vegetable I've ever tasted.  

Chicken has comparatively little fat content compared to other meats, and thus, not as flavorful from a meaty flavor standpoint, but those words are also probably meaningless to you.

Without any frame of reference or point of comparison, a verbal explanation is not going to prepare you for the experience.  You're over thinking this. 

Take the plunge and jump into the water.
